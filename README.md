# Concatenation Function

 Your job is to write a function called `concatFunction` that will accept TWO strings as parameters and return the value of those two strings concatenated.

## Hints
- DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAME! For the tests to work, it needs to retain the current name
- This will only test the functionality of the `phone_number` function in the javascript file. You can add whatever code you need elsewhere to ensure you are doing the right thing.
- This will be testing the data COMING OUT of the function, NOT data displayed on the screen.
- ignore the other files in this repo. The only file you need to modify is the `concatenation_function.js`"

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone 
```

2. Enter Concatenation Function repo
```bash
cd Concatenation-Function
```

3. Run an NPM install to enable the automatic tests
``` bash
npm install
```

4. Run npm test to execute tests when you think you have solved the issue and are redy to test.

```bash
npm run test
```

5. Commit your answers and push code.
